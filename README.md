# Give me Alpha!
The "Make me money without making me money" model. 

This project got started as a joke when one of the traders I followed on X (GryptoGoon), made this post:
https://x.com/GryptoGoon/status/1852502524248355206

Where his brother's professor appears to be sniffing around for profitable trade ideas.
I threw this repo together as a possible response, it's look good on paper, but really isn't.

## Gotcha's
THIS IS NOT A RIGORUS BACKTESTING PIPELINE
As a signal this is completely useless and performance is due to overfitting on historical data.
That's only part of the bad-news: When frictions, short-term taxes and a direct comparision to buy-and-hold are factored in,
it's actually a losing system, so please, DON'T TRADE THIS.
