# Give me Alpha!
The "Make me money without making me money" model. 

This project got started as a joke when one of the traders I follow on X (GryptoGoon), made this post:
https://x.com/GryptoGoon/status/1852502524248355206

Where his brother's professor appears to be sniffing around for profitable trade ideas.
I threw this repo together as a response.

The idea was to present a decently well structured pipeline that looks good on paper, but doesn't actualy give away any edge.
My personal opinion on this is:
IF YOU HAVE AN EDGE, YOU NEVER GIVE IT AWAY, EVER!
- You don't do it for a professor in a class
- You don't do it for a hedge fund interview
- You don't do it in a research submission
- And you don't do it for a few subscription $$
Actual trading edge that will overcome frictions is very difficult to find.
